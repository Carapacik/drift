  ///
  /// # Basic Usage
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// // Simple running total example
  /// final runningTotal = WindowFunctionExpression<double>(
  ///   items.price.sum(), // aggregate function
  ///   orderBy: [OrderingTerm.asc(items.date)],
  /// );
  ///
  /// // Use in a query
  /// final query = select(items).addColumns([runningTotal]);
  /// ```
  ///
  /// # Partitioning
  ///
  /// Partition data into groups before applying the window function:
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// // Running total per category
  /// final runningTotalByCategory = WindowFunctionExpression<int>(
  ///   items.price.sum(),
  ///   orderBy: [OrderingTerm.asc(items.date)],
  ///   partitionBy: [items.categoryId],
  /// );
  /// ```
  ///
  /// # Frame Boundaries
  ///
  /// ## Rows Frame
  /// Operates on physical rows:
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// // Moving average of previous 3 rows and current row
  /// final movingAverage = WindowFunctionExpression<double>(
  ///   items.price.avg(),
  ///   orderBy: [OrderingTerm.asc(items.date)],
  ///   boundary: RowsFrameBoundary(
  ///     start: -3, // 3 rows preceding
  ///     end: 0,    // current row
  ///   ),
  /// );
  /// ```
  ///
  /// ## Groups Frame
  /// Operates on groups of rows with same ORDER BY values:
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// // Include current group and one group before
  /// final groupFrame = WindowFunctionExpression<int>(
  ///   items.quantity.sum(),
  ///   orderBy: [OrderingTerm.asc(items.category)],
  ///   boundary: GroupsFrameBoundary(
  ///     start: null, // Unbounded preceding groups
  ///     end: 0,    // current group
  ///   ),
  /// );
  /// ```
  ///
  /// ## Range Frame
  /// Operates on value ranges (default):
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// // Sum of items within price range of Â±10 from current row
  /// final rangeFrame = WindowFunctionExpression<int>(
  ///   items.quantity.sum(),
  ///   orderBy: [OrderingTerm.asc(items.price)],
  ///   boundary: RangeFrameBoundary(
  ///     start: -10, // 10 units less than current value
  ///     end: 10,    // 10 units more than current value
  ///   ),
  /// );
  /// ```
